# microservices_architecture

## This is my demo microservices application to understand how various decomposed services work with each other to achieve a wholesome application which is scalable and can be managed independently. My aim for this applicatio is to exlore various cloud offerings ranging from IAAS PAAS, Dockerrization and also Kubernestes.
